# Week 4, Sunday 31/March

- Splash Screen done. [Rishabh Bhatia]
- Colour and UI elemnts decided. [Rishabh Bhatia]

# Week 4, Henry notes
- This file needs significantly more edits, so I can match dates with attendance.php entries and ensure fair grades at end of trimester.
- You need much more progress. Deakin requires a minimum 10-14 hours per week, per unit, in order to pass.

# Week 5, Wednesday 3/April [Henry]
- This project needs more work to meet the pass hurdle.
- Include multi-line comments (/* */) before each function, to outline what the function does, any arguments and return types, and how to use it.

# Week 5, Sunday 7/April [Aditya]
- Created To-Do feature for the app this week. [Aditya Singh Kushwah]
- WHICH FILE(s)? [Henry]

# Week 6, Monday 8/April [Henry]
- You both need a minimum 2 days per week to pass under normal circumstances. 
- I need to get serious with you here: To catch up, you'll need to do much more. If you're not intending to pass, look into withdrawing from the unit and trying again next year.

# Week 6, Thursday 11/April [Henry]
- When you summarise a feature, if it was a single file, also say which file was updated [Henry]

# Week 6, Friday 12/April [Aditya]
Added more details to comments in the following files, explaing the working of ToDo feature of the app:
- app/src/main/java/rishabh/notelocker/ToDo.java [Aditya Singh Kushwah]
- app/src/main/java/rishabh/notelocker/db/AccessData.java [Aditya Singh Kushwah]
- app/src/main/java/rishabh/notelocker/db/OpenDatabase.java [Aditya Singh Kushwah]

# Week 6, Friday 13/April [Rishabh]
Created new Activity to Add Lock Screen functionality to the Application. Also Fixed some bugs which were preventing the app from showing the app icon.
Some directories/Activities that were created/modified are as follows:
- app/src/main/java/rishabh/notelocker/CreatePasswordActivity.java
- src/main/java/rishabh/notelocker/EnterPasswordActivity.java
- app/src/main/java/rishabh/notelocker/SplashScreen.java

# Week 7, Monday 15/April
- Feedback: Good job doing some work. But I still don't see enough progress happening each week (minimum 10 hours of coding). I'd like you to start writing the time taken per changelog item (in brackets at the end of each line), so that you can see where time is being spent / not being spent enough. [Henry]
- Feedback: Only need to list the main files edited, not every file (e.g. xml files don't matter, only code). [Henry]
